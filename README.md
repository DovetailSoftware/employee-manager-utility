# employee-manager-utility

EMU is an administration utility that allows an administrator to associate employee properties (such as queues, office location, supervisor, and resource configuration) to a
workgroup.

EMU is a Clarify Classic Client add-on product. 

New employees that are assigned to that workgroup can automatically inherit all of the proper attributes. This will speed up and simplify the process of adding new employees to the Clarify
database, since most of the attributes for an employee will be defined by the type of job they are destined to be performing.

When an employee changes work assignments, the attributes of the new workgroup can override the current settings for the employee automatically just by changing the workgroup.
